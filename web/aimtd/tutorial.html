			<h4 align="center">Intro</h4>
			<p>
				The AIMTD API is written in Java, and it currently supports 2D monster movement in all 8 directions. The 
				main class responsible for movement decisions is the Coordinator, which essentially acts like a game 
				clock for AIMTD Monsters.<br/>
				The Coordinator's tick() method signals all Monsters to move according to the map layout, the Monster's 
				intelligence level and movement speed, and various other game factors. Most TD games will probably call 
				tick() once every frame or two.
			</p><br/>
			
			<h4 align="center">Instantiating the Coordinator</h4>
			<p>
				To instantiate the Coordinator, you'll need to pass in a Map, which is a grid-based representation of 
				your TD level. If you're not using a grid-based system, that's not really a problem - points in the grid 
				represent coordinates rather than "grid tiles". Here's an example 20x20 map grid:
				<p align="center">{<br/>
				{0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,0,1,0,8,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,0,8,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0},<br/>
				{0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0},<br/>
				{0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0},<br/>
				{0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},<br/>
				{0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2}<br/>
				}</p>
				...where 1s represent "walkable" points, 2s represent objectives, 0s represent "unwalkable" coordinates
				(upon which towers could be built), and 8s represent dead space.<br/>
				The Map constructor takes an int[][] like the one above; the resulting Map object can be used to instantiate 
				your level's Coordinator. By default, Maps will allow monsters to travel between diagonally adjacent points,
				although this feature can be turned off during Map construction.
			</p><br/>
			
			<h4 align="center">Adding Monsters to the Coordinator</h4>
			<p>
				AIMTD monsters must inherit from the Monster class. The Monster class constructor takes in the monster's starting 
				coordinates, health points, speed, and intelligence level as parameters -
				<ul>
					<li>
						Starting coordinates: the Monster's starting point in the grid.
					</li>
					<li>
						Health points: the amount of Tower damage this Monster can sustain before dying.
					</li>
					<li>
						Speed: the distance this Monster can cover in a single tick of the Coordinator. A speed of 100 means the
						Monster can cover a Euclidean distance of 1 for each Coordinator tick().
					</li>
					<li>
						Intelligence level: determines this Monster's movement behavior. With an intelligence level of 1, 
						the Monster will always follow the shortest path towards the nearest objective. With an intelligence 
						level of 2, this Monster will follow the path that's least likely to get it killed. With an intelligence 
						level of 3, this Monster will coordinate with other nearby level 3 Monsters in order to cause the most 
						damage possible; for example, a low-health level 3 Monster may trail behind a high-health level 3 monster 
						in order to take cover.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Once you've instantiated your Monster, you can add it to the Coordinator through the addMonster() method - 
				subsequent calls to the Coordinator's tick() will move the monster for you. After each tick, you can 
				get the Monster's new coordinates through its getX() and getY() methods.<br/>
				It's important that you use setHp() to update your Monster's health points as it heals or takes damage.
				Accurate health readings allow the Coordinator to make informed decisions for Monsters with intelligence 
				levels of 2 or above.
			</p><br/>
			
			<h4 align="center">Adding Towers to the Coordinator</h4>
			<p>
				AIMTD Towers work much like Monsters. Your towers must inherit from the Tower class, which require you to 
				specify Tower coordinates, fire damage, fire rate, and fire range -
				<ul>
					<li>
						Coordinates: the Tower's coordinates in the grid.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fire damage: the amount of health points that a single bullet from this Tower will subtract from any 
						given Monster.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fire rate: the Tower's firing speed; a speed of 100 means the Tower can shoot a single bullet within
						one Coordinator tick().
					</li>
				</ul>
				You can then add Towers to the Coordinator through the addTower() method (the Coordinator does not process Tower
				firing decisions yet). Knowledge of all Towers on the Map simply allows the Coordinator to make informed 
				pathfinding decisions for Monsters with intelligence levels of 2 or above.
			</p><br/>
			
			<h4 align="center">Summary</h4>
			<p>
				To get started with AIMTD:
				<ol>
					<li>Construct a Map from a grid-based representation of your TD level's relevant coordinates.</li>
					<li>Instantiate a Coordinator using the Map you made.</li>
					<li>Add Monsters/Towers to your Coordinator through the addMonster()/addTower() methods.</li>
					<li>Call tick() each time you want to make Monsters move.</li>
					<li>Get your Monsters' new coordinates through the getX() and getY() methods.</li>
					<li>Add or remove Monsters/Towers as needed.</li>
				</ol>
